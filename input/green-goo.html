You're [G7]walking down the street minding business of your own.
You [C7]think you are safe, do you [G7]think you are alone.
But then some creepy dude comes walking past you.
He [A7]tilts back his head, and he [D7]gives a big ker-choo! [Eb7] [D7]

CHORUS:
Green [G7]goo, green goo.
[C7] It doesn't matter what you [G7]do.
Green goo, green goo.
[D7] It's going to [C7] get all over [G7] you.

You [G7]step into a restaurant, a Mexican buffet.
Some [C7]girl who wants a tacos screams get [G7]out of my way!
You trip over the rug trying to get out of her path.
[A7]Next thing you know you're in a [D7]guacamole, bath! [Eb7] [D7]

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
Now if I [C7]had some blue glue and I [G7]mixed it with red,
then I [D7]have some purple goo that I could [G7]dump on your head.
But if I [C7]had some yellow glue, I could [G7]mix with that blue,
do you [A7]know what I get? Oh yes, I [D7]think that you do. [Eb7] [D7]

CHORUS

[D7] It's going to [C7]get all over,
[D7] It's going to [C7]get all over,
[D7] It's going to [C7]get all over [G7] you.
