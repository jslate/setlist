VERSE 1

So [C]many different [Am]foods of different [F]colors you [G7]see,
the [C]orange of an [Am]orange, a red [F]cherry in a [G7]tree.
But [C]if you see some [Am]blue food, you [F]know that something's [G7]wrong.
The [C]only place for [Am]blue food's in this [F]silly little [G7]song.

CHORUS

Blue [C]food, blue [Am]food, it's [F]giving me a [G7]fright.
Blue [C]food, blue [Am]food, I've [F]lost my [G7]appetite.
Blue [C]food, blue [Am]food, I [F]don't want to [G7]take a bite
of [C]blue food. [Am] [F] [G7]

VERSE 2

You could [C]eat some leafy [Am]greens, they are so [F]good for [G7]you.
Or a [C]lightly tanned [Am]bagel is so [F]yummy to [G7]chew.
A [C]yellow lemon [Am]might make you [F]pucker, it's [G7]true.
But a [C]yellow lemon's [Am]better than [F]any food that's [G7]blue.

CHORUS

BRIDGE

Now [F]blueberries are blue on the [C]outside, it's true.
And [F]blueberries are very very [C]good for you.
But [F]if you take that [F#dim]blueberry and [C]cut it in [A7]two,
you'll [Dm7]find it on the inside it's a [G7]very purple hue.

VERSE 3

I [C]hope that someone [Am]out there takes [F]exception to this [G7]song
And [C]thinks of some [Am]blue food that will [F]prove me [G7]wrong.
But [C]I hope you know [Am]there's one way that [F]I will not be [G7]beat.
No [C]artificial [Am]colors, so [F]please don't [G7]cheat.

CHORUS

Blue [C]food, blue [Am]food,
it's [F]giving me a [G7]fright…
[C]something just ain't [G7]right…
it [C]keeps me up at [G7]night…
[C]take from my [G7]sight…
