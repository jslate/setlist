      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan is onstage with his electric guitar, ready to introduce the concept. Becky looks on with concern.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (enthusiastically) Alright, everyone! Today, we&#8217;re going to teach the children about something really cool in music: distortion!</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (worried) Distortion? But isn&#8217;t that a bit&#8230; rebellious?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (reassuringly) Well, personally, I think it’s better for kids to learn about distortion in a safe, controlled environment while they’re parents are here if they need them. Because, like it or not, they are going to encounter distortion out there in the real world. We can’t protect them forever.</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Becky nods, still a bit apprehensive. Jonathan starts with the first riff.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with something mild. Here&#8217;s a classic riff from the late &#8217;50s called &#8220;Rumble.&#8221; It’s considered one of the first ever songs to feature distorted guitar. </p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(He plays the riff from &#8220;Rumble&#8221; by Link Wray. Becky listens and then nods in approval.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (getting into it) Okay, that wasn&#8217;t so bad. What&#8217;s next?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (smiling) Time to kick it up a notch with &#8220;Born to Be Wild&#8221; from the late &#8217;60s. Remember, kids, if you’re confused or overwhelmed, you can always turn to a parent. Everyone ready?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(He plays the opening riff from &#8220;Born to Be Wild&#8221; by Steppenwolf. Becky starts to move to the music, clearly enjoying it.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (excitedly) Oh, I like that! More, more, more!</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (Uncertain) Remember, this is for the kids, right?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (excitedly) Yeah, yeah, the kids, whatever. I mean… the kids want more distortion! Don’t you, kids!? (gestures to get the to cheer) See?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (Uncertain) Um, ok, sure. Here&#8217;s some Led Zeppelin you might like.</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(He plays the riff from &#8220;Whole Lotta Love.&#8221; Becky is now fully rocking out, hair all over the place? Horns gesture, etc. Jonathan stops and looks at Becky uncertainty)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> What?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> I think that might be enough distortion for now. </p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> But we still have to play [Green Goo]!</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> Oh, right!</p>
