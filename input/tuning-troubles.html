      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">The Distortion Lesson</strong></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan is onstage with his electric guitar, ready to introduce the concept. Becky looks on with concern.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (self-importantly) Alright folks, we’re going to play the next song in just a minute. But first must tune my guitar. Now it’s important that I can tune my guitar without noise, distractions, or interruptions. (Looks meaningfully at Becky). </p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2">(Becky nods in an exaggerated way, signaling understanding. Jonathan starts tuning, a few seconds go by.)</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> Hey, Jonathan! I just have one question&#8230;</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan, absorbed in his task, raises a hand for silence without looking up.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Becky tries to get Jonathan&#8217;s attention a few more times, each time a bit more exaggerated. Jonathan shows increasing signs of annoyance.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (sighing) Okay, okay. If I let you ask your question, will you let me tune my guitar in peace?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (nodding eagerly) Yes, yes, absolutely!</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan stops tuning and turns to face Becky, expectantly.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (innocently) Do you know how to tune a guitar?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan looks exasperated, placing a hand on his forehead.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (sarcastically) Of course, I do! It’s what I’m trying to do RIGHT NOW! </p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(The audience laughs. Jonathan goes back to tuning. Becky crosses over down stage right. She goes to a bag and pulls out a rubber fish, signaling to the audience to be quiet.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (interrupting again) Hey, Jonathan?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Jonathan puts his hand on his face.)</em></p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Jonathan:</strong> (resigned) Yes, Becky?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><strong class="font-bold">Becky:</strong> (grinning) I know you can tune a guitar, but can you tuna fish?</p>

      <p class="max-w-prose mt-2 mb-2"><em class="italic text-gray-500">(Before Jonathan can respond, Becky tosses the rubber fish at him. Jonathan catches it awkwardly, pretending to be flustered. The audience erupts in laughter.)</em></p>
