[C]Whose [G]pigs be [C]these? [C]Whose [G]pigs be [C]these?
Well they [C]are John [G]Potts, you can [Am]tell them by the [Em]spots,
and I [F]found them in the [G]vicarage garden!

There's a [C]Merrick [G]sow and she's [Am]bigger than a [Em]cow

If I [C]find them [G]again gonna [Am]put them in my [Em]pen

Got my [C]knife and [G]fork and I'm [Am]ready for some [Em]pork
