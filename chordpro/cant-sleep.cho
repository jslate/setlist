┃ When you're laying a ┃ [C]wake [G]       ┃ [D] and you're feeling a ┃ [C]lone [G]       ┃
┃ [D] It can seem like a ┃ [C]curse [G]       ┃ [D] that is solely your ┃ [C]own [G]       ┃ [D]     ┃

┃ [Em]Know that I’m ┃ [F]out there, ┃ [C]I’ve been there just like ┃ [G]you, if ┃
┃ [Em]it brings you ┃ [F]comfort ┃ [C]you can sing it ┃ [D7]too       ┃

┃ [Em]Of a chorus of ┃ [F]millions ┃ [C]who share this burden ┃ [G]too, and ┃
